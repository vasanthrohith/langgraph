His belief in hard work and perseverance made him detest shortcuts to achieving, as he disqualified his son from the Chūnin Exams for using the banned Kote, and expressed disgust at Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki for their reliance on harvesting from Chakra Fruits to lazily gain power.[38]\\nAfter the death of his master Jiraiya, talking to his father Minato and listening to Nagato's tragic story, Naruto grew to understand the destructive cycle of hatred and he vowed to break it in order to bring true peace to the world.[39] He has picky eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as attempts to peep into women's baths, although these moments are rare.[32] Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him to the point of being labelled the ultimate problem child, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,[33] inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view and thus built meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred.[34] In the anime, shadow clones were able to: save the members of the Sasuke Recovery Team from the reincarnated Sound Four's Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover;[146] update Tatewaki about the fates of the children he was responsible for during life, granting him peace and allowing him to return to the afterlife;[147] run in to Yota, a childhood friend, and giving Yota a chance to play with him again before releasing himself from the Impure World Reincarnation;[148][149][150] assist Omoi in saving the Thundercloud Unit.[151]\\nFourth Shinobi World War: Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.[18] Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself.\"}]\n",

       "{'keys': {'documents': [Document(page_content=\"5. As you may know, Jiraiya was an author, as well as the teacher of Minato, Naruto's father. His first book, The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi featured a protagonist who held the ideals of Jiraiya and was called - Naruto (possibly named so after the food). Minato liked the book very much and decided to name his son after this character.\\nNaruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the title character and main protagonist of the series: Naruto. He is a genin-level shinobi from Konohagakure, and a member ofTeam Kakashi. A maternal descendant of the Uzumaki clan, Naruto is the third and current jinchūriki of Kurama — the Nine-Tails. Despite once being ostracised by the majority of the village, he is now regarded ...\\nNaruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto) (/ ˈ n ɑː r u t oʊ /) is the titular protagonist of the manga Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto.He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf Village (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れ, Hepburn: konohagakure).As a boy, Naruto is ridiculed and ostracized on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that ...\\nNaruto's shonen protagonist is none other than the titular Naruto Uzumaki himself, a legendary anime hero with incredible ninjutsu, a memorable visual design, and most of all, a stellar, inspiring personality that everyone loves.Of course, he's not a perfect human being.Naruto can be insecure, petty, or even mean sometimes. On the whole, however, his personality is defined by his best traits ...\\nNaruto was told then by Shikamaru that the reason why Kurotsuchi was acting that way was because she was being pressured by the Earth Daimyō to invade the Land of Flowers for the corps they had to offer and expressed sadness that Kurotsuchi didn't tell them as he believed that the Shinobi Union would have definitely aided her when it came to food scarcity and other issues and the potential of another war, remembering the casualties of the last war and not wanting to use and introduce the next generation to the horrors of war. His belief in hard work and perseverance made him detest shortcuts to achieving, as he disqualified his son from the Chūnin Exams for using the banned Kote, and expressed disgust at Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki for their reliance on harvesting from Chakra Fruits to lazily gain power.[38]\\nAfter the death of his master Jiraiya, talking to his father Minato and listening to Nagato's tragic story, Naruto grew to understand the destructive cycle of hatred and he vowed to break it in order to bring true peace to the world.[39] He has picky eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as attempts to peep into women's baths, although these moments are rare.[32] Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him to the point of being labelled the ultimate problem child, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,[33] inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view and thus built meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred.[34] In the anime, shadow clones were able to: save the members of the Sasuke Recovery Team from the reincarnated Sound Four's Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover;[146] update Tatewaki about the fates of the children he was responsible for during life, granting him peace and allowing him to return to the afterlife;[147] run in to Yota, a childhood friend, and giving Yota a chance to play with him again before releasing himself from the Impure World Reincarnation;[148][149][150] assist Omoi in saving the Thundercloud Unit.[151]\\nFourth Shinobi World War: Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.[18] Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself.\")],\n",
